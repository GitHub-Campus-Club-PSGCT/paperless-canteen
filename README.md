Introducing the ultimate university canteen experience! With our new mobile app, you can easily order and pay for your meals, skip the line, and enjoy your food at your convenience. Download our app today and revolutionize your university dining experience!
 
Going green has never been easier! Our mobile application is designed to reduce paper waste and make your dining experience more efficient. By ordering and paying for your meals through the app, you can skip the need for paper receipts. Not only will this save trees, but it will also save you time by allowing you to order ahead and avoid long lines.

Another critical issue we wish to contribute towards is reducing food waste. 
Our new ML model uses linear regression to predict the demand for food items in the university canteen. By analyzing past sales data the model can accurately predict which items will be in high demand on a particular day. This allows us to better plan for inventory and ensure that the canteen always has enough of the most popular items.
